## 🧭 Learning & Development Roadmap (Q3–Q4 2025)

> My personal learning goals to level up as an ML Engineer:

- [x] Build 3–4 end-to-end ML projects (EDA → Model → Deployment)
- [x] Solve 150+ DSA problems (focus on arrays, strings, trees, graphs)
- [ ] Integrate **MLflow** for experiment tracking
- [ ] Implement **model explainability** (SHAP / LIME)
- [ ] Learn **Docker** for containerizing ML apps
- [ ] Explore **LangChain & LLMs** for GenAI workflows (Q4 goal)
- [ ] Write technical blogs explaining my projects
- [ ] Contribute to open-source ML projects (optional but planned)
