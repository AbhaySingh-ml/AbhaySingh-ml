**Entry-Level Data Scientist | Fraud & Risk Analytics**  
Python • Machine Learning • Imbalanced Classification • Model Evaluation

I am an entry-level Data Scientist with hands-on experience building **machine learning models for risk-sensitive classification problems**, particularly on **highly imbalanced datasets**. My focus is on **evaluation-driven ML**, where metric selection and decision trade-offs matter more than raw accuracy.

I hold a Master of Computer Applications (MCA) and a background in Commerce, which helps me approach ML problems with a **risk and decision-making perspective**, especially in FinTech-related use cases.

## 📂 Selected Projects

### Credit Card Fraud Detection
Binary classification on a real-world credit card transaction dataset (~284K records, ~0.17% fraud rate).

- Selected precision–recall metrics over accuracy due to extreme class imbalance  
- Analyzed threshold trade-offs between missed fraud and false alerts  
- Avoided synthetic oversampling to preserve realistic evaluation conditions  
- Deployed an interactive Streamlit application for prediction analysis
